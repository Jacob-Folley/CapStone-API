Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #35 | 10 wins & 15

Determined to become like the championship's star player, a short boy nicknamed \"the small giant\", Shouyou joined his school's volleyball club. Unfortunately, he was the only member and the club didn't have so much as a place to practice. He didn't let that deter him, however, and, upon finally acquiring 5 other players in his final year, was able to compete in an actual competition - only for his team to be unlucky enough to face the championship favorite and its star player, Kageyama Tobio, called \"the king of the court\", in the first round. Though Shouyou's team suffers a crushing defeat, he vows to become better and eventually surpass Kageyama. Now Shouyou is starting his first year in high school - the very one he had first watched in the national championships. He's going to join the volleyball team, practice constantly, and wipe the floor with Kageyama the next time they meet on the court. ...or at least that's what Shouyou had planned, until he discovers that he and Kageyama are now in the same school. The volleyball team definitely needs their skills, but only if they can stop bickering and learn to work together as teammates.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #110 | Awards1 win & 3 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Ayumu Murase, Kaito Ishikawa, Yu Hayashi","starList":[{"id":"nm4986852","name":"Ayumu Murase"},{"id":"nm5481013","name":"Kaito Ishikawa"},{"id":"nm2106149","name":"Yu Hayashi"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm4986852","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ayumu Murase","asCharacter":"Shoyo Hinataas Shoyo Hinata"},{"id":"nm5481013","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kaito Ishikawa","asCharacter":"Tobio Kageyamaas Tobio Kageyama"},{"id":"nm2106149","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yu Hayashi","asCharacter":"Ryunosuke Tanakaas Ryunosuke Tanaka"},{"id":"nm2174227","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmM0MjRkYjMtNzhiYS00YmNmLTlmMmYtMjlkOWE0NzQzNzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Satoshi Hino","asCharacter":"Daichi Sawamuraas Daichi Sawamura"},{"id":"nm0997115","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjA4M2Q5NDItN2FjNi00NTg3LWE3MTEtOWM0NDJmODk1YjQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Miyu Irino","asCharacter":"Koshi Sugawaraas Koshi Sugawara"},{"id":"nm2146022","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Koki Uchiyama","asCharacter":"Kei Tsukishimaas Kei Tsukishima"},{"id":"nm6160361","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"S√¥ma Sait√¥","asCharacter":"Tadashi Yamaguchias Tadashi Yamaguchi"},{"id":"nm2462004","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nobuhiko Okamoto","asCharacter":"Yu Nishinoyaas Yu Nishinoya"},{"id":"nm2893431","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzRlOTM1ZGEtMjAyMC00ZjFiLWIyOGItMjFlYWU0NTk0NmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Yoshimasa Hosoya","asCharacter":"Asahi Azumaneas Asahi Azumane"},{"id":"nm0436778","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmI4ZmNkYjAtMzhlZC00ODFjLWIwOWItNjczODJlNzk5ZjM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hiroshi Kamiya","asCharacter":"Ittetsu Takedaas Ittetsu Takeda"},{"id":"nm7645092","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Toshiki Masuda","asCharacter":"Chikara Ennoshitaas Chikara Ennoshita"},{"id":"nm5236687","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bryson Baugus","asCharacter":"Shoyo Hinataas Shoyo Hinata"},{"id":"nm9587581","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Greg Cote","asCharacter":"Ryunosuke Tanakaas Ryunosuke Tanaka"},{"id":"nm10074926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Justin Doran","asCharacter":"Daichi Sawamuraas Daichi Sawamura"},{"id":"nm3654365","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Adam Gibbs","asCharacter":"Koshi Sugawaraas Koshi Sugawara"},{"id":"nm7659217","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Scott Gibbs","asCharacter":"Tobio Kageyamaas Tobio Kageyama"},{"id":"nm7850199","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gabriel Regojo","asCharacter":"Kazuhito Naritaas Kazuhito Narita‚Ä¶"},{"id":"nm1453891","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWQzZjI2ZmQtZGI4ZC00YzY5LWEzNmUtZDA4ZDQ3OTI1ODJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Leraldo Anzaldua","asCharacter":"Kei Tsukishimaas Kei Tsukishima"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS), Production I.G., Shueisha","companyList":[{"id":"co0114908","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS)"},{"id":"co0002212","name":"Production I.G."},{"id":"co0049595","name":"Shueisha"}],"countries":"Japan","countryList":[{"key":"Japan","value":"Japan"}],"languages":"English, Japanese","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"Japanese","value":"Japanese"}],"contentRating":"TV-14","imDbRating":"8.7","imDbRatingVotes":"14433","metacriticRating":"","ratings":{"imDbId":"tt3398540","title":"Haikyuu!!","fullTitle":"Haikyuu!!

Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young immortal witch, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #117 | 4 wins","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jun Fukuyama, Takahiro Sakurai, Johnny Yong

In 1853, the US fleet commanded by Admiral Perry forced the doors open, leading to a modernization of the nation's sociopolitical systems and the eventual fall of the Shogunate. The samurai regime ended its life with the imperial restoration in 1868. That's what history tells, but in Gintama, that's not what happens. Instead of the US fleet, the country is stormed by spaceships coming from four corners of the universe and soon we see it occupied by extraterrestrials. The Shogunate has become a puppet of alien occupation armies. All samurais have been disarmed and reduced to temp workers with no skills who just try to make ends meet. Gintama is a story of a handyman named Gintoki, a samurai with no respect for rules set by the invaders, who's ready to take any job to survive. He and his gang, however, are also among the very few who have not forgotten the morale of a swordsman. Wherever they go, all they do is to create troubles. Troubles that they of course try to solve, but in reality...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"1 win","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Tomokazu
